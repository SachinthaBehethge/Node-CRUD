 1. Asynchronous Mastery
You already started here — great.

✅ You should deeply understand:

Callbacks, Promises, async/await

Event Loop & microtasks/macrotasks

Streams & Buffers (especially for Node.js)

Error handling in async code (e.g. unhandled promise rejections)

🧰 2. Node.js Core Knowledge
If you're working backend with Node:

fs, path, http, events modules

Process management (process, child_process)

Memory and performance profiling (node --inspect)

Clustering and load balancing

Logging (e.g. Winston, Pino)

📦 3. Package Management & Tooling
Deep understanding of npm, yarn, and monorepos (e.g. Lerna, Nx)

Semantic versioning

Using and publishing private/public NPM packages

🔐 4. Security Best Practices
Input validation & sanitization (avoid injection)

JWT authentication / OAuth2

Preventing common attacks:

XSS, CSRF, SQL Injection, NoSQL Injection

Rate limiting & CORS handling

🏗️ 5. Architecture & Design Patterns
MVC, MVVM, Clean Architecture

Dependency Injection

Middleware in Express

Repository pattern for DB

Singleton, Factory, Observer, etc.

⚙️ 6. Testing & Quality
Unit testing (Jest, Mocha, Vitest)

Integration testing (Supertest, Postman)

Code coverage

Test-driven development (TDD)

Linting (ESLint), Prettier

🧪 7. Advanced JavaScript Concepts
Closures, this, hoisting, scopes

Prototypes & Inheritance

ES6+ features: destructuring, spread, rest, optional chaining, etc.

Memory leaks & garbage collection

⚡ 8. Performance Optimization
Lazy loading, caching strategies (Redis)

Debouncing/throttling

Profiling (Chrome DevTools, Node profiler)

Database query optimization

☁️ 9. DevOps & Deployment
Docker, Docker Compose

CI/CD (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.)

Monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana, Sentry)

Reverse proxies (Nginx), PM2, systemd

Cloud platforms (AWS, Vercel, Heroku)

🗃️ 10. Databases (SQL + NoSQL)
MongoDB: Schema design, indexing, aggregation

PostgreSQL/MySQL: Joins, views, stored procedures

ORMs: Mongoose, Prisma, Sequelize

👥 11. Soft Skills (Senior = Leader)
Mentoring juniors

Code reviews

Writing docs

Estimating tasks

Leading architecture decisions

Communication with product/UX

🌱 BONUS: Things that make you stand out
WebSockets (real-time apps)

Serverless (AWS Lambda, Vercel Functions)

GraphQL

TypeScript

Building CLIs (e.g. with commander, inquirer)
